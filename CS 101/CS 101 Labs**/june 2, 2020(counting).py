#program that handles multiple elements in a list

# 1.    User enters elements of a list. They enter an empty line
#       when they are done entering elements.
#       For examplle the list is ['Flower', 'Sun', 'Flower', 'Beach', 'Sun']
# 2.    Program counts the number of occurences in each elements in the list
#       that becomes a dictionary: { "Flower" : 2, "Sun" : 2, "Beach" : 1 }â€¨
# 3.    The program converts the dictionary back to a list of couples
#       (elements, occurences)
#       That becomes a list of couples: [ ('Flower', 2), ('Sun', 2), ('Beach', 1) ]
# 4.    Program outputs this list of couples
# 5.    Revert the list of couples back to the initial user list
